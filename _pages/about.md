Hello there ðŸ‘‹. I am a fourth-year BS/MS student at Vanderbilt University, studying computer science and pure mathematics.

At Vanderbilt, I work in the <a href='https://mint-vu.github.io/'>Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT) Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://skolouri.github.io/'>Prof. Soheil Kolouri</a>. I am also currently working with <a href='https://math.vanderbilt.edu/aldroua/'>Prof. Akram Aldroubi</a>. In the past, I have worked closely with <a href='https://dcmoyer.github.io/'>Prof. Daniel Moyer</a>, <a href='http://www.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/~koutsoxd/'>Prof. Xenofon Koutsoukos</a>, and <a href='https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/?pid=mudassir-shabbir'>Prof. Mudassir Shabbir</a>.

I have also previously worked as a software engineering intern at <a href='https://www.meta.com/'>Meta</a>, and a quantitative trading intern at <a href='https://sig.com/'>Susquehanna International Group (SIG)</a>.

<!-- <b>Research Interests:</b> I am interested in designing scalable, efficient, and explainable machine learning systems that can reliably solve real-world problems. More specifically, my research interestes include geometric deep learning, representation learning, computational optimal transport, and algorithms/complexity theory. -->
