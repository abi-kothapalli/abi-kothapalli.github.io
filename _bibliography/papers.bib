    abstract={Comparing spherical probability distributions is of great interest in various fields, including geology, medical domains, computer vision, and deep representation learning. The utility of optimal transport-based distances, such as the Wasserstein distance, for comparing probability measures has spurred active research in developing computationally efficient variations of these distances for spherical probability measures. This paper introduces a high-speed and highly parallelizable distance for comparing spherical measures using the stereographic projection and the generalized Radon transform, which we refer to as the Stereographic Spherical Sliced Wasserstein (S3W) distance. We carefully address the distance distortion caused by the stereographic projection and provide an extensive theoretical analysis of our proposed metric and its rotationally invariant variation. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed metrics and compare them with recent baselines in terms of both speed and accuracy through a wide range of numerical studies, including gradient flows and self-supervised learning.},

    abstract={A dominating set in a graph is a subset of its vertices such that each vertex in the graph is either in the set or has a neighboring vertex in the set. The minimum dominating set problem seeks to find a dominating set of minimum cardinality and is a well-established NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. We propose a novel learning-based heuristic approach to compute solutions for the minimum dominating set problem. Our approach uses a graph convolutional network to generate a series of probability maps over the vertices in a given problem instance, and we then treat these maps as heuristic functions to construct dominating sets. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed method on a novel synthetic graph dataset, real-world graph datasets, and existing minimum dominating set benchmark datasets. Our results indicate that the proposed learning-based approach can outperform a classical greedy approximation algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalization capability of the graph convolutional network across datasets and its ability to scale to graphs of higher order than those on which it was trained. Finally, we utilize the proposed learning-based heuristics in an iterated greedy algorithm, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the computation of dominating sets.},

    abstract={Learning from set-structured data, such as point clouds, has gained significant attention from the community. Geometric deep learning provides a blueprint for designing effective set neural networks by incorporating permutation symmetry. Of our interest are permutation invariant networks, which are composed of a permutation equivariant backbone, permutation invariant global pooling, and regression/classification head. While existing literature has focused on improving permutation equivariant backbones, the impact of global pooling is often overlooked. In this paper, we examine the interplay between permutation equivariant backbones and permutation invariant global pooling on three benchmark point cloud classification datasets. Our findings reveal that: 1) complex pooling methods, such as transport-based or attention-based poolings, can significantly boost the performance of simple backbones, but the benefits diminish for more complex backbones, 2) even complex backbones can benefit from pooling layers in low data scenarios, 3) surprisingly, the choice of pooling layers can have a more significant impact on the model's performance than adjusting the width and depth of the backbone, and 4) pairwise combination of pooling layers can significantly improve the performance of a fixed backbone. Our comprehensive study provides insights for practitioners to design better permutation invariant set neural networks.},

    abstract={Tissue engineering and gene therapy strategies offer new ways to repair permanent damage to mechanosensory hair cells (MHCs) by differentiating human Wharton’s Jelly cells (HWJCs). Conventionally, these strategies require the classification of each cell as differentiated or undifferentiated. Automated classification tools, however, may serve as a novel method to rapidly classify these cells. In this paper, images from previous work, where HWJCs were differentiated into MHC-like cells, were examined. Various cell features were extracted from these images, and those which were pertinent to classification were identified. Different machine learning models were then developed, some using all extracted data and some using only certain features. To evaluate model performance, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve was primarily used. This paper found that limiting algorithms to certain features consistently improved performance. The top performing model, a voting classifier model consisting of two logistic regressions, a support vector machine, and a random forest classifier, obtained an AUC of 0.9638. Ultimately, this paper illustrates the viability of a novel machine learning pipeline to automate the classification of undifferentiated and differentiated cells. In the future, this research could aid in automated strategies that determine the viability of MHC-like cells after differentiation.},
